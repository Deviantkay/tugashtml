                <h2>Music arrangements</h2>
                <p>My first hobby is creating arrangements of songs into synthetic orchestral music using FL Studio, which is a Digital
                Audio Workstation (DAW) program. Through this hobby, I am able to explore various types of instruments and sounds that
                can be combined into a song arrangement.</p>
